Task: Add Tower ID to Connection Chart

Summary:
Enhanced the charting engine to visualize Tower ID history alongside 5G Band changes in a single combined chart.

Details:
- Renamed the '5G Band' chart to 'Connection Info / Tower & Radio Bands'.
- Implemented dynamic mapping of unique Tower IDs (GNBID) to distinct Y-axis levels.
- Added a Magenta step-line series representing the Tower ID history.
- Updated Y-axis ticks to display human-readable labels for both bands (n71, n25, n41) and actual Tower IDs.
- Applied the same tiered smoothing logic to the tower series for long-duration reports.

Files Modified:
- internal/charting/charting.go: Major refactor of the connection info plot logic.
