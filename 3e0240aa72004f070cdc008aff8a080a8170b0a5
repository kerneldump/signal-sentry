Task: Chart Smoothing for Signal Bars

Summary:
Implemented dynamic downsampling and smoothing for the Signal Bars chart to enhance trend visibility over long durations (e.g., 24h+).

Details:
- Added a 'downsample' helper function using bucket averaging.
- Implemented time-based trigger: Smoothing activates only if data duration > 2 hours and total points > 300.
- When active, the Reported Bars (black line) switches from a discrete Step-Line to a continuous Smooth-Line.
- Other charts remain at raw resolution to maintain detail.

Files Modified:
- internal/charting/charting.go: Added downsample logic and conditional styling.
