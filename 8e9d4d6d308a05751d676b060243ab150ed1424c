Task: Refactor main.go to use the variable interval instead of the refreshRate constant
Summary: Updated the main loop to sleep for 'time.Duration(*intervalPtr) * time.Second'. Removed the hardcoded refreshRate constant.
Files: main.go
Why: To finalize the implementation of the configurable refresh rate feature.
