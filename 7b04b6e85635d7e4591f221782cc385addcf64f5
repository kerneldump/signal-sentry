Task: Move data structures from main.go to internal/gateway/models.go
Summary: Created internal/gateway/models.go with the GatewayResponse and related structs. Added a unit test to verify JSON marshaling.
Files: internal/gateway/models.go, internal/gateway/models_test.go
Why: To separate data models from the main application logic, enabling reuse and better organization.
