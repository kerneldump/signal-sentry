Task: Logarithmic Scale for Latency Chart

Summary:
Switched the 'Latency & Packet Loss' chart to use a Logarithmic Y-axis. This prevents extreme outliers (high latency spikes or StdDev) from compressing the normal operating range data into a flat line.

Details:
- Applied 'plot.LogScale' to the Y-axis of the first chart.
- Implemented data sanitization to ensure all plotted values are >= 0.1, as Log(0) is undefined.
- Used 'plot.LogTicks' for improved readability of the logarithmic scale.

Files Modified:
- internal/charting/charting.go: Updated scale configuration and data loop.
