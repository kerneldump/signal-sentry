Task: Add Bar Averages and Signal Health Metric

Summary:
Enhanced the historical analysis report and charts with a new 'Signal Health' metric and statistical bar averages.

Key Changes:
- Implemented a weighted 'Signal Health' score (1.0-5.0) based on RSRP (70%) and SINR (30%).
- Added 'BARS AVG' section to the analyze report showing Overall average, Last 1h average, and Signal Health.
- Updated the 'Signal Bars' chart to display both Reported Bars and the calculated Signal Health line.
- Optimized 'Last 1h' calculation by iterating backwards from the end of the data range.
- Added comprehensive unit tests for the scoring logic and report integration.

Files Created:
- internal/analysis/scoring.go
- internal/analysis/scoring_test.go

Files Modified:
- internal/analysis/analysis.go: Updated Report struct and Analyze logic.
- internal/charting/charting.go: Integrated Signal Health line into the bars subplot.
