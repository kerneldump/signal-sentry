Task: Chart Grid Layout (2x2)

Summary:
Reorganized the chart output from a 1x4 vertical stack to a 2x2 grid layout. This makes the generated image more compact (wider but shorter) and easier to view on standard screens.

Layout:
- Top-Left: Latency & Packet Loss
- Top-Right: Signal Strength (RSRP/SINR)
- Bottom-Left: Signal Bars (Reported & Health)
- Bottom-Right: 5G Band

Visual Updates:
- Signal Bars chart now uses a High-Contrast style:
    - Reported Bars: Solid Black Step-Line (0.8pt).
    - Signal Health: Light Grey Filled Area with Dark Grey Border.

Files Modified:
- internal/charting/charting.go: Updated canvas dimensions and grid coordinates.
