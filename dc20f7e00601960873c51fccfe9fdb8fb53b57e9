Task: 24h Smoothing Trigger for All Charts

Summary:
Extended the dynamic chart smoothing logic to cover all metrics (Latency, Signal, Bands) for very long duration datasets (> 24 hours).

Triggers:
- Bars Chart: Smooths if Duration > 2 hours (Target 300 pts).
- Other Charts: Smooths if Duration > 24 hours (Target 600 pts).

This ensures that daily reports remain detailed while weekly/long-term trends are rendered efficiently and cleanly.

Files Modified:
- internal/charting/charting.go: Added tiered smoothing logic for the 24h threshold.
