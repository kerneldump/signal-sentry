Task: Add Date Range Filtering for Analysis

Summary:
Implemented time-based filtering for the 'analyze' and 'chart' subcommands, allowing users to focus on specific time windows.

Features:
- Added '-range', '-start', and '-end' flags to both subcommands.
- '-range' accepts relative durations (e.g., '24h', '30m') calculated from the current time.
- '-start'/' -end' accept ISO 8601 dates (YYYY-MM-DD [HH:MM:SS]).
- Updated analysis report to display the active filter and the actual data range covered.
- Filtering is applied during log parsing for efficiency.

Files Modified:
- main.go: Added flag parsing and wiring for filter creation.
- internal/analysis/filter.go: New file implementing TimeFilter logic.
- internal/analysis/analysis.go: Updated Analyze and ParseLog to respect the filter.
- internal/analysis/filter_test.go: New tests for filtering logic.
- internal/analysis/analysis_test.go: Updated tests for signature changes.
