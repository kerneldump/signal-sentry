Task: Track Real-Time Signal Bars

Summary:
Enhanced the historical analysis report to indicate the current (most recent) signal bars status.

Details:
- Updated the 'BARS SEEN' section to append a 'real-time' suffix to the bars value observed in the last log entry.
- This helps users quickly correlate historical signal strength distribution with their current connection quality.

Files Modified:
- internal/analysis/analysis.go: Added LastBars tracking to Report struct and print logic.
- internal/analysis/analysis_test.go: Added TestAnalyzeRealTimeBars to verify the new marker.
